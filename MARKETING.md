# Marketing Materials - Cyber Kill Chain Tracker

## LinkedIn Post

---

Every cyberattack follows a pattern. Most security teams realize it too late. 🎯

I built a **Cyber Kill Chain Tracker** that visualizes threats using Lockheed Martin's own framework—the same methodology used to defend critical infrastructure worldwide.

What it does:
✅ Maps threats across all 7 kill chain stages in real-time
✅ Simulates attack progression so you can see how adversaries move
✅ Provides stage-specific mitigation recommendations
✅ Tracks active, contained, and remediated threats with alerting

The defense industry doesn't just react to threats—they anticipate them. This tool demonstrates that proactive approach through interactive visualization.

Built with React, TypeScript, D3.js, and Tailwind CSS. Fully deployable on GitHub Pages for live demos. 🚀

Whether you're training SOC analysts or demonstrating threat intelligence workflows, understanding the kill chain changes everything.

What stage do you find most organizations fail to detect threats? I'd say Command & Control—it's often the last chance before Actions on Objectives. 🤔
